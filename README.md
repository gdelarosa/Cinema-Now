### Notes
This is a fun personal project that is currently ongoing with no deadline so changes may occur at any time. Will it be app store ready? 🤷🏽‍♀️ Will it look awesome 💁🏽‍♀️? Yes! 🔥 Will it be perfect? No... 🤡. As far as the UI, I was inspired by the Netflix app and wanted to create something similar with the horizontal scrolling effect on the home screen.
