### Notes
This is a fun personal project that is currently ongoing so changes may occur at any moment. I did not give myself a deadline and I have no intention to make this into a full blown app for the app store. I wanted to work on a fun and free API. I was also inspired by the Netflix app and wanted to create a similar UI to that.
